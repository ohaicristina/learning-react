# Notes and Projects while finally sitting down and learning React for real instead of just bumbling around a codebase copying recognizeable code patterns until something works

This repo is home to various project files filled with raw, unedited notes and comments to myself as I learn how to actually use React among other things.

## Learning List

I'm currently working through [ui.dev](https://ui.dev/)'s [React Course](https://ui.dev/react/). I'm also working through [SuperHi]'s [https://www.superhi.com/] [JavaScript for Designers](https://www.superhi.com/courses/javascript-for-designers) but this repo doesn't contain any of that work (as of now anyway) since it's self contained on their site.

- 🔜 [React Router](https://ui.dev/react-router-v5/)
- 🔜 [React Hooks](https://ui.dev/react-hooks/)

## Who are you? What is this?

I'm just a product designer who realized she'd rather be a developer.

I've be working as a designer who's more than comfortable jumping into the [front of the front-end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/) since my first co-op at Northeastern. Being Type A af, I always wanted the most control over how designs were implemented so it just made sense for me to work HTML + CSS into my roles. But then I got to the point where the thought of opening Sketch to make pixel adjustments across dozens of screens made me want to commit a crime and that I honestly could not care less about arguing over how small or large a button's border radius should be and I said "I guess I'm a ~fRoNt EnD dEVeLoPeR~ now".

Except I wasn't? I mean, I ~~was~~ am. But I really "wasn't" and still don't feel like I am sometimes because I don't have a CS degree and I really couldn't tell you what is the difference between object-oriented and functional programming. I honestly try not to care anymore because the main thing I still care about is making easy to use (and easy on the eyes) tools on the internet for people to use.

My existing front-end knowledge (years of HTML + CSS of all flavors, working in Rails codebases, working in React codebases, eventually getting a handle of components and props) carried me really far, but I'm at the point where I just need to sit down and actually learn what the hell a `Context` is in React and maybe finally understand what the hell `.map()`, `.filter()`, and anything array related actually means.

This is my attempt to learn out in the open. You can read more on my blog. No promises about update frequencies.
