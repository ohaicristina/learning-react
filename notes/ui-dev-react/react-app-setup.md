# Getting a React project set up from scratch

the easy way is to just use `create-react-app`

hard way involves a few steps. (note: these are just general steps that i wrote down from memory after following along with course project)

1. npm init
2. install webpack and babel npm packages
3. add app directory, add .gitignore
4. index.html, index.js, index.css
5. set up and configure webpack
6. babel config in package.json
7. set up scripts to build and run servers
