# Functional components

**Note:** this is "old" react, hooks allows you to set a state on functional components if you wante

For components that just take in some props and output UI, (aka no state) you can use "functional" components.

Functional components _don't have a `this`_ keyword
(so you can just do `props.name` instead of `this.props.name`)
