# Intro to Props

Compositional systems **need and interface** to accept data from outside of itself.

`props : components :: arguments : functions`
^ this simple analogy made things super obvious about the whole concept of components

- `this.props` = an object with properties
- props can be any type of data
- weirdly enough, reading through this section helped me understand using an object as a prop better
